/*
 This is the example of serial data reception
 In this case laptop/computer is sending the data serially to Arduino via USB port
 Arduino will receive the data serially and we will use the serial data byte received
 for controlling the onboard LED
 If 'A' is received serially then LED will be turned ON
 If 'B' is received serially then LED will be turned OFF
